These words are here to provide the reader with a basic impression of how actual text will appear in its final presentation.

                Think of them merely as actors on a paper stage, in a performance devoid of content yet rich in form. That being the case, there is really no point in your continuing to read them. After all, you have many other things you should be doing. Who's paying you to waste this time, anyway, as Iâ€™ve mentioned before.</p>
